# itc172-calendar

I worked on the Calendar assigment which covers:

- Create a new empty web site.
- Add a Web form.
- Add a Calendar control, one textboxes and a button.
- The user will select their birthdate on the calendar and enter their name into the textbox. When they click the button, the page will return their name and how long it will be until their next birthday.
- Add a simple CSS sheet to style the page.
- Make the output of how long until their next birthday green.
